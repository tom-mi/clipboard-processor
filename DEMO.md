# The Quest of Merlin the Admin
### Demo text for clipboard-processor v0.3.0
Every godforsaken morning, Merlin the Admin awoke at the stroke of `0 5 ? * MON-FRI *`. It was far too early an hour for any respectable wizard to face the world, and yet his duties required it. He grumbled and spat, cursing the cruel machinations of time as he rose from his hay-stuffed mattress.

No sooner had he muttered a grumpy greeting to the morning than a pigeon arrived, bearing a scroll. The scroll contained a pesky little encoded message, `SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh`, from his old friend, Archmage Horatio. Merlin squinted at the paper, sighed, and lamented, "Blasted base64. For once, send me a note that doesn't need deciphering, you old codger!"

As he stumbled out into the grim light of dawn, Merlin set his sights on the nearby castle. It was a cursed nuisance having to make this trek each day, particularly for his aging joints, but duty called, and he had a habit of answering begrudgingly.

The journey to the castle was not without its annoyances. Along the way, Merlin kicked what he thought was a rock, only for it to be a rusted fragment of an old haycart with the markings `1HGCM82633A123456`. "Blasted VINs," Merlin muttered. "I thought those infernal contraptions stopped plaguing me when I swore off blacksmithing!"

Upon reaching the castle gate, he was met with another bureaucratic ordeal. To gain entry, Merlin needed to utter the so-called "magic" hex passphrase, `74657374`. He muttered it with a sneer and mused aloud, "Pathetic security. Wouldn't trust my grandmother's broomstick with it. A `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJsb2dnZWRJbkFzIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJpYXQiOjE0MjI3Nzk2Mzh9.gzSraSYS8EXBxLN_oWnFSRgCzcmJmMjLiuyu5CSpyHI=` token would make more sense!"

Unperturbed by Merlin's grumbling, the castle guard recorded his grievances under the unix time `1746804148`, a detail that nearly sent Merlin's blood pressure through the roof. "You dolts still using timestamps? Who keeps a log this way in the age of ULIDs? An `01JTTT82NTP6VJPX4CR9V3KBHK` would not only preserve your precious records but reduce future headaches!"

Finally granted entry, Merlin shuffled through the stone hallways and arrived at the chamber of the enchanted mirror. Its duties included revealing one's true identity, and, with alarming regularity, some distasteful truths. Looking behind the mirror for some ill-defined purpose, Merlin noticed a brass plate labeled `B8:27:EB:12:34:56`. He chuckled, feeling a twinge of nostalgia for OUI parsing days long gone. "Even riddled with wizardly contemplation, you can't escape those MAC addresses," Merlin groaned.

But as Merlin the Admin glared at his reflection, his gripes ceased for a moment, realizing that his life, much like the confounded strings his world was so infested with, occasionally needed some parsing to be well understood.
